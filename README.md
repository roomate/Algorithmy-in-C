This repository presents three first-year computer science classes given at ENSTA Paris, in C language. You can find here my own code to the practical sessions given during the class; 
five to six for each of them. They explore in their own way various concepts of programming and algorithmy in C; indeed, C is an interesting language for beginners to learn in many way, the more important one being it is a said low-level language. That is, its functioning is closely related to how a computer actually works. It forces the student to understand rigorously 
how the memory is managed by the computer, e.g. allocated or freed, and quit the cosy world of high level language.

Each of these courses has a specific theme: 
- IN101: Algorithmy et programmation. This course teach how to efficiently solve a given problem with an algorithm written in C.
- IN102: Advanced C language. This course introduces the syntax of the C language and some important notions of low-level language such as pointer, struct and memory allocation.
- IN103: Resolution of algorithmic problems. This course introduces the more important data structures often employed in real-world applications; dictionnary, tree, queue... Each TP is a mini-project putting in practice these important examples.
